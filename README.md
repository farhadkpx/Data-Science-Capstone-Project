## **Summary overview of the Coursera 'Data science Capstone Project'**

### Instructions

The goal of this project is to display that a student have gotten used to working with the real-life data and on track to create prediction algorithm, which will provide an interface that can be accessed and used by others. Basic course instructions are:
  - Demonstrate that you(student) have downloaded the data and have successfully loaded it in.
  - Created a basic report of summary statistics about the data sets.
  - Report any interesting findings that you amassed so far.
  - Get feedback on your plans for creating a prediction algorithm and Shiny app.

### On Project Submission
Provide a user-interface and 5-slides that will display a summary overview of the project

* A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.
* A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter.

### There are four main '.R' files that contributes to the project.

* `1. ui.R` : Primary app user interface file.
* `2. Server.R` : Server file listens user input and provide feedback.
* `3. model_algotihm.R` : Next word prediction model.
* `4. RdsFileCreation.R` : A copy of the milestone file.

## N-Gram design


## Building the language model



### Limitation and Scope
* The total combination file size is extremely big
* The reduced file size may not be truly representative of the three files
* The tm-package cleaning processes avoids unusual signs or marks
